# A review
## Intro
The Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University via Coursera offers a "10-courses introduction to Data Science".

The courses cover:  
- the basics of R programming  
- the methodology of "being a good data scientist" (more on that later)
- some statistics courses, mostly aiming at covering the basics
- introduction courses to hot topics such as machine learning and natural language processing.  

The courses have been built some time around 2013, and have barely been updated since (in fact, only one course has been vaguely updated around 2015, as far as I can tell). Nevertheless, this specilization still, in 2020, appears in most of the "top data science specializations" rankings available online, for an honnest price.

## Context   

A tiny bit about me, only what is relevant for the review:  
- I am a trained engineer with a solid background in maths. I don't work as an engineer, though.  
- I had close to no prior experience with programming - about 10 years ago I self-taught myself visual basic to be able to customize macros on excel, and that's about it.  
- "Thanks" to the covid-19 pandemic, I've had a lot of time on my hands in the last two months.  

## My review  
### Content / topics covered  
The specilization covers in my opinion an impressive amount of topics.  

The first courses introduces you to R programming, which is a language not as popular as Python, but noneless apparently widely used *for data analysis purposes*. You learn to compute data, make fancy graphs, reports and presentations (with code included) and a bit down the road online apps.  

In all courses, a lot of emphasis is put on what "being a good data scientist" is. That is: formulating your problem, your hypothesis, your goal(s); selecting your data, cleaning it, making sure it's the right data, of good quality, representative etc.; building your research in a "clean" and reproducible way; and finally communicating your results properly. That is probably the most important thing in the whole specialization, as it is what is (unfortunately) often overlooked in real life.  

Two courses introduce the students to the basics of Statistical Inference and Regression Models. These present fundamental concepts; however, they are only introductory and if you want to learn more, you'll need to look elsewhere. (see next section for more details).  

Finally, two "hot topics" are covered in this specilization: machine learning and natural language processing. Both are, again, introductions to the topics - you'll be nowhere near being a specialist of neither of these once you're done. 

All in all, the specialization does, in my opinion, a great job of introducing the students to a variety of topics. Learning to code along the way and actually developping yourself models and coding apps is what worked for me at best. I've taken a few other courses on coursera (on other topics), but watching videos only doesn't work for me - I tend to fall asleep mid-way through. 
I went from knowing more or less nothing on the subject to being able to collect data, build analysis and prediction models and even code an interactive app to present these in under two months. That is amazing!  
Needless to say, I got hooked and I will clearly be diving deeper into the fields which interest me most.  

### Quality
A few things here:  
1. Coursera, the platform, is great. It's extremely well built, the courses are nicely cut into short lectures spread on "weeks" to keep you motivated. To allow "self-paced" courses, grading is done via quizzes and peer-reviews. (which is not without its shortages, more on that later)  
2. Considering it's an introduction specilization, in my opinion it does a great job at *introducing* the topics. For each course I did, I spent probably more time googling more info / reading and watching other resources on the topic / browsing Stack Overflow that I did watching the videos on the platform. It doesn't bother me, as in the end the courses gave me a frame or guideline to tackle Data Science, and the price I paid is reasonable (44â‚¬/month, and since it took me two months to finish... Do the math) The lectures themselves are rather ok, except - unfortunately - the statistics lectures. These are... A catastrophe. The poor guys is trying, but I could barely follow, which is a problem considering these topics are fundamental to understand machine learning etc. I found myself relying heavily on reviving my memory and on other youtube videos.  
3. The main problem is that it's old, and clearly not maintained. Too often presented code chunks "don"t work" because they were meant to be run with an older version of R. Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing have evolved in 7 years, so the "recommended" algorithms are outdated. Only "mentors" are around on the fora to help a bit, but nothing got updated. It's a shame, as it really is a great course.  
4. The requirements to pass the assignments are also very low - actually, the content itself is almost never graded, only "did the student try", and that's pretty much it. Not that it really matters, but when you spent 5 hours perfecting your analysis and your report and you get graded on "did the report has 3 but not more than 5 graphs" and "did it have an introduction", it can get frustrating. It's also linked to...   
5. ...Plagiarism. Since everything is online, and since these courses have been around for ages, it is incredibly easy to find not only the answers to all quizzes, but also former students' projects and the associated code on github. Of all the peer assessments I reviewed, at least 2/3 were plagiarized (probably more, these are only the prefect Google matches). Amazingly, many students didn't even *try* to hide it, submitting links to reports with other people's names on it and dating back to 2014-2017. I personally don't understand the point of taking these courses if it's not to learn something - this is a non-credit specialization, and I really hope no employer would hire someone to work as a data scientist just because they did an online course, without actually checking their skills. It doesn't take anything from what I learned, but again, it's frustrating to know so many people will pass and "get" the certificate without having "earned" it. 

### Conclusion  
All in all, you get what you put in. I had so much fun doing this course, I had no problem spending 12 hours in a row in front of my PC, some days even forgetting to eat lunch (yes, as I said, *I have time*).

I loved it. I'm happy I did it. I can't predict the future, I don't know if that will have any kind of impact on my career. But for sure it kept me busy during a time where I needed it a lot, and it gave me a bazillion ideas of things I could do. *Stay tuned* ;-)
